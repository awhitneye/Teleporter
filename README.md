#Teleporter
Teleporter is a mobile app that utilizes the experimental WebVR API through the A-Frame VR framework.

The app uses A-Frame and AngularJS for DOM manipulation to render photospheres in virtual space. The VR environments that immerses the user are equirectangular photos fetched from the Flickr API.
Teleporter has a unique and intuitive UI; gazing at the sphere injected into the scene opens a menu for the user to choose the theme of the photosphere they would like to be teleported to next.
